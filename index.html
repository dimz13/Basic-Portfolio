                    <p id="details">Hello there! I'm Dimple Shanbhag, budding full stack developer and lifelong learner. Finance and
                        Telecom domains are where I have contributed. Started off my career in Testing and moved onto
                        automation. From here I moved to frontend development.
                        When i was given the opportunity to be part of a tools development team and given the front end
                        responsibility I found my calling. Presenting a nice
                        usable UI for even the most technically challenged person , across different browsers and
                        screens, and elegant code with reusable components.....whats not to like. Its a thrill ride
                        everytime. The constant changes and new frameworks that are available is a challenge to keep up
                        with.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="details2">Outside of work and learning, I'm a podcast junkie. I listen to any an every podcast I can get my
                        hands on. I'm a big fan of the Joe Rogan podcast.My commute times are my podcast listening
                        time(Makes it so much more enjoyable)
                        Reading fiction and non-fiction is also a major past time. I have memberships in multiple county
                        libraries and use Libby to borrow both audio and ebooks. Free access to libraries is one of the
                        things I love about this country. In many other countries you have to have a paid membership to
                        borrow books.What can I say I love libraries.
