    <p>Hello there! I'm Dimple Shanbhag, budding full stack developer and lifelong learner. Finance and Telecom domains are where I have contributed. Started off my career in Testing and moved onto automation. From here I moved to frontend development.
     When i was given the opportunity to be part of a tools development team and given the front end responsibility I found my calling. Presenting a nice
     usable UI for even the most technically challenged person , across different browsers and screens, and elegant code with reusable components.....whats not to like. Its a thrill ride 
     everytime. The constant changes and new frameworks that are available is a challenge to keep up with.  
    </p>
    <p>Outside of work and learning, I'm a podcast junkie. I listen to any an every podcast I can get my hands on. I'm a big fan of the Joe Rogan podcast.My commute times are my podcast listening time(Makes it so much more enjoyable)
       Reading fiction and non-fiction is also a major past time. I have memberships in multiple county libraries and use Libby to borrow both audio and ebooks.  Free access to libraries is one of the 
       things I love about this country. In many other countries you have to have a paid membership to borrow books.What can I say I love libraries.
